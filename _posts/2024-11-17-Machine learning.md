Jaccard coefficient is a measure of similarity between two sets. It can be calculated as follows.

A∩B: intersection of two sets.

A∪B: union of two sets.

Checking the table, it can be calculated as follows.

1, (Jack,Mary);
The number of intersections {1} is 1.
Whole parts 1, 0, and 1 appear throughout.
The unique value is 3.
Therefore, J(Jack,mary) is 1/3

2, (Jack,Jim);
The number of intersections {1} is 0.
Whole parts 1 and 0 appear throughout.
The unique value is 2.
Therefore, J(Jack,mary) is 0/2=0

3, (Jim,Mary);
The number of intersections {1} is 0.
Whole parts 1, 0, and 1 appear throughout.
The unique value is 2.
Therefore, J(Jack,mary) is 0/3=0
