## unit1~3


## unit4
First, I organized the data so that each cell has a single value in the first normal form. Next, I eliminated partial functional dependencies in 2NF. I divided attributes that are not completely dependent on the primary key into separate tables. Since all attributes are directly dependent on the primary key at the time of 2NF, the requirements for the third normal form are met. I will use Python's Pandas and Numpy to convert data. Next, I will talk about primary and secondary keys. Primary keys allow you to manage each database table. Primary keys do not contain NULL and are the basis for establishing relationships between tables. Secondary keys are used to search and sort data. For referential integrity, you can use an SQL query to search for data and check whether results are obtained. For example, I can use the code in the Appendix. By using this, you can search for records where the primary key of Table1 and the foreign key of Table2 match, and check whether referential integrity is maintained. The benefits of normalization were confirmed in Susanne (2024).

## unit5
I learned about compliance in handling data using lecture texts and articles. The first thing I recognized was that data security and data compliance are different. Security is merely a minimum compliance with laws and security standards. Therefore, this cannot be called safe. GDPR, which is listed in GDPR EU (2018), is a standard for data compliance. Specific actions to be taken include access control, encryption in data storage, and the need to pay attention when discarding data. These are described in IBM (2023).

## unit6
In this unit, I learned about DBMS. This is generally MySQL (2024) and the like. The advantages of using it include ensuring data security, reducing redundancy, removing data inconsistencies, and ensuring data sharing. However, the disadvantages include the complexity for people who do not normally use DBMS and the cost of maintaining it. Therefore, it is important to design while thinking about future system maintenance. Also, when building a database, if you are a beginner, it is better to use something that is widely used. The reasons for this are that it has solid support, there are many solutions on the Internet in case of trouble, and there is a high possibility that it will continue to be upgraded in the future. There are four types of DBMS, including hierarchical database management systems.

## unit7
For example, Twitter Developer at X (N.D.) is an example of a Twitter API. First, I evaluate the security requirements. First, I consider authentication and authorization methods. Here, it is necessary to implement access control. Next, I consider data protection. Data transfer encryption and masking of confidential data are required. Next comes error handling. Finally, logging and auditing are required. The next step is to create Python code to connect to the API. For example, in this case, use the code described in the Appendix. Finally, create a specification for security requirements. Here is an example. First, authentication and authorization. The API key is stored as an environment variable and not hard-coded. Next, to protect data, all API requests are sent using HTTP/TLS. In addition, confidential data is masked and only the minimum amount of data required is obtained. Error handling is to log errors and display error messages to users that do not contain confidential information. Finally, logging and auditing is to log API access, monitor unauthorized access, and regularly audit logs. For these, I referred to Mendo (2024).

## unit8
First, I decided to create an executive summary based on the comments received in unit6. Since there were comments about the structure, I decided to create the text in paragraphs. In addition, since there was no information about legal compliance and compliance requirements in Unit6, I added information. There were also comments that the python code and other information had not been included, so I added them in the appendix. I also added more references and focused on making the logical development more persuasive. Furthermore, by using diagrams effectively, I was able to explain the relationships between tables, which are difficult to understand with text alone. I also wrote about database selection and data cleaning automation, and I believe that I was able to further strengthen my ability to propose to customers. I believe that I was able to learn important points about database construction that I did not understand at the end of Unit 6 through Units 7 to 10. I felt that the assignments in Units 7 to 10 were very meaningful because I was able to deepen my knowledge, which was only outlined at the end of Unit 6.
